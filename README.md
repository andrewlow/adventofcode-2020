# Advent of Code 2020 https://adventofcode.com/2020

My attempts to participate.

I've included my code solutions - so spoiler alert - if you go looking you will find code solutions.
I am not sharing the puzzle data, only the sample data for the puzzles.

## Notes

- Day 1: Great start, reading files, doing math. N cubed.
- Day 2: Basic string processing
- Day 3: Building the right in memory representation is key
- Day 4: Regex fun. Having the right debug statements helps a lot
- Day 5: Mapping results to internal bitmap
- Day 6: Python set functionality saves the day (overlap)
- Day 7: Parsing and recursion.
- Day 8: State machine.
- Day 9: Not really crypto.
